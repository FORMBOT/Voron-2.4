# Configuration & Basic Macros

You still need to adjust a few things which are depending on your printer size!

Go through the config carefully. Everyone is responsible for their own configuration and for any damage that may occur due to incorrect configuration. "Uncomment" means remove the "#" in front of the line.

After you completed the first steps of your configuration, follow the [Voron Initial Startup Guide](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/startup/) to set up everything else and be sure it works correct.
Follow [slicer setup](https://docs.vorondesign.com/build/slicer/) to set up your slicer.

Now that everything is set up, it's time for the [secondary Printer tuning](https://docs.vorondesign.com/tuning/secondary_printer_tuning.html) so your first print won't be a complete disaster.
